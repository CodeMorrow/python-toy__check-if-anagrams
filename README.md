# Toy Problem - Python

## Check if Anagrams

### Objectives

1. Practice thinking through abstract algorithms.
2. Properly use common data structures.

Anagrams are words made from the same set of characters. Like this:

We would say that `"chaser"` and `"search"` are anagrams; because if you rearrange the letters in one of the words, you can end up with the other word. Anagrams have _exactly_ the same letters--no more or less of any letter--but arranged differently.

Write an algorithm that figures out if two strings are anagrams for each other. If the strings _are_ anagrams, the algorithm should return `true` as its final response. Otherwise, it should return `false`.

### Getting Started

After forking this repo and opening it in your development environment (e.g. Cloud9), run `bin/setup`. This will install any software that this exercise depends upon.

Your work belongs in the file called **test_something_something.py**. There is no **lib/** directory for this project. Modify the function(s) in the provided Python file(s). To check if you have passed this exercise, run `bin/check`. This will run a series of automated tests and provide you with errors and/or feedback.

Do not change the name of the function. Simply alter the body of the function to get the tests passing.
